Modular Dialogue System
Nova Jones - ATCM 3368.001


How to use:
The “TextBoxDialogue” script is where all adjustments can be made. The “UniversalDialogueManager” is required and is what makes the dialogue appear and determines when to start and end. 
Features include:
Preset animated text box that slides up onto screen and down off of screen when dialogue starts and ends.
Text can be inputted in the inspector, and is displayed in a character by character typing format.
The name of the character can also be edited in the inspector.
4 different variants of textbox - just dialogue, name and dialogue, portrait and dialogue, and lastly, portrait and name and dialogue.
The portrait sprite can be swapped out with any square sprite to represent the character talking, the base sprite in the package is a character I drew as an example.
The background color of the portrait can be changed in the inspector.
The color of both name and dialogue text can be changed in the inspector.
